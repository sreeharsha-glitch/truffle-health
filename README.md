# Truffle Health Frontend (React) Assessment

The following assumptions and implementations were made based on task details and design files provided:

1. Designing on frontend codebase.
2. For state management, I used React Context API. I could have used Redux but I thought it would be an overkill for this project.
3. For styling, I used Chakra UI, a component library for React.
4. The task process was developed by assuming real-world scenarios, and the state management was designed accordingly.
5. For file upload, the uploaded bill image has been converted to blob url and stored in the state. The blob url is then used to display the image in the UI.
6. Initially, 2 bills are loaded temprarily in the state, and the data will be reset when the page is refreshed.

## Project Setup and Run

1. Clone the repository OR unzip to project folder.
2. Run `yarn` OR `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `yarn start` OR `npm start` to start the project.
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Tech Stack, Libraries and Tools

1. React
2. Chakra UI, Emotion, and Framer Motion for styling & animations.
3. `react-router-dom` for routing.
4. `react-icons` for icons.
5. `react-hook-form` for form handling.
6. `yarn` for package management.
7. `VS Code` as IDE.
